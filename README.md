# Outliers Treatment Template

This repository provides a Python-based template for handling and treating outliers in data analysis projects. It is designed to make outlier detection, visualization, and treatment accessible and reusable for data scientists and analysts.

## Features

- Fully modular and reusable template.
- Built for **Jupyter Notebook** environments.
- Multiple outlier detection techniques:
  - Z-Score
  - IQR (Interquartile Range)
  - Modified Z-Score
  - Visual techniques (e.g., boxplots, scatter plots).
- Options for handling outliers:
  - Removal
  - Transformation
  - Capping/Winsorization
- Extensible for custom methods and workflows.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook provided in the repository.
2. Load your dataset into the template using the data loading section.
3. Select the desired outlier detection method and customize parameters if needed.
4. Choose an outlier treatment approach and apply it to your dataset.
5. Export the cleaned dataset for further analysis.

## Example Workflow

Here is a brief example of how to use the template:

1. **Load Data**: Upload your dataset (e.g., CSV or Excel file).
2. **Detect Outliers**: Run the detection functions to identify outliers.
3. **Visualize Outliers**: Use the visualization tools to inspect the data.
4. **Treat Outliers**: Apply transformations, capping, or removal techniques.
5. **Save Results**: Save the cleaned dataset to a new file.

### Next Steps:
1. Convert `Outlier Treatment_Flowchart.pdf` to an image format (e.g., PNG).
2. Upload the image to the repository.
3. Update the `README.md` file with the correct path to the uploaded image.
